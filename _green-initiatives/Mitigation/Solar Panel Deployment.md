Solar is currently the most viable renewable energy source for Singapore. Over 630 megawatts-peak (MWp) of solar capacity has been installed, and we are on track to achieving our target of at least 2 gigawatts-peak (GWp) by 2030. This could generate enough electricity to meet the needs of 350,000 households.  
  
To maximise solar deployment in our highly-urbanised environment, conventional rooftop solar has been complemented with innovative ways of deploying solar on spaces such as water bodies, temporary vacant land, and sheltered walkways.  
  
Singapore opened one of the world’s largest inland (60 MWp) floating solar photovoltaic (PV) system at one of our reservoirs in 2021. This generates enough energy to allow us to have a 100% green waterworks system. We are also exploring the deployment of large-scale floating solar PV systems at two other reservoirs which could potentially triple our solar energy supply.

Floating solar photovoltaics are increasingly adopted in Singapore. The 1.5 megawatt-peak floating solar deployment at Lower Seletar Reservoir helps to offset energy demand from nearby infrastructure.
