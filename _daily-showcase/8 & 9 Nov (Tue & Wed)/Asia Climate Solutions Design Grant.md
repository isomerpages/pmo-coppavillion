Convergence, with support from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has conceptualized the Asia Climate Solutions Design Grant, building on Convergence’s seven years of success with similar initiatives. It will provide early-stage grants for high-impact climate financing solutions in Asia. The goal is to create a pipeline of investable transactions that could significantly scale-up private investment for climate finance in the developing markets. Family offices and philanthropic foundations can play a key role as catalytic grant capital providers for this Design Grant.  
  
Convergence, by launching the Design Grant and establishing an Asia-Pacific regional office in Singapore, aims to familiarise family offices and like-minded investors in Singapore and beyond with opportunities to invest in blended finance for climate, thereby helping to catalyse Asia’s net zero transition, supporting Singapore’s national Green Plan 2030 and establishing Singapore as a sustainable and transition financing centre.
