In Singapore’s “‘City in Nature”’, future roads and streets will become ‘nature ways’, helping deliver regenerative city design. Nature ways support living system design and enhanced natural systems in an urban context. Nature ways also support various natural ecosystems including biodiversity, water, food and more.  
  
In this research piece, Arup helped identify how can Autonomous Vehicle-enabled streets help catalyse a ‘City in Nature’ and quantifying the benefits of increased greenery. It presents an urban regenerative design showcase where in the future more land is given back to nature in our cities as future transport becomes more efficient. Reallocating space to greenery provides key benefits such as urban heat island reduction, reduced storm water run-off, biodiversity connectivity, and improved active mobility.
