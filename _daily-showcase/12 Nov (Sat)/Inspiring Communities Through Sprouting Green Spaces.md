City Sprouts is a social enterprise inspiring communities through sprouting green spaces and programs that educate and grow our way towards a more sustainable future. We focus on the social activation of spaces anchored on a sustainable lifestyle - our spaces raise awareness of food security, farming methods, food waste and closing the loop.
