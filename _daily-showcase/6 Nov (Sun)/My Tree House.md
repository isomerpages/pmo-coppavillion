Green Library for Kids  
  
Initiated by CDL in conjunction with the National Library Board (NLB) in 2013, My Tree House is the world’s first green library for kids located at the Central Public Library and was created to encourage and facilitate environmental literacy and love for nature amongst younger generations.

Every year, in the lead up to World Environment Day, CDL and NLB jointly organise My Tree House’s Eco Storytelling Contest for children from 3 to 12 years of age.

The contest with four different categories aims to promote family bonding through storytelling, as well as to encourage young eco champions and their families to develop their love for nature and to take action to protect the planet.

In this year’s edition of the contest, themed “City in Nature”, winners were invited to a special award ceremony as part of CDL’s Youth4Climate initiative, in which Robert Swan, OBE, presented prizes to the young eco-champions.
