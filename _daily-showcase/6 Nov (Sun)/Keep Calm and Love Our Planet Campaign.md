In November 2021 at Glasgow’s COP26, CDL launched our “Keep Calm and Love our Planet” campaign in partnership with Singapore Youth for Climate Action. The campaign consists of a series of initiatives to rally youths from around the world to support our vision of “Turning Climate Anxiety into Positive Action” and promote positive thinking and creative collaboration for climate solutions.
