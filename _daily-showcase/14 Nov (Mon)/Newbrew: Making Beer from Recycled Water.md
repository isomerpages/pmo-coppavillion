NEWBrew, is a unique craft beer made using NEWater, Singapore’s own brand of ultra-high grade recycled water. It is an initiative by national water agency PUB, in collaboration with Brewerkz, Singapore’s longest-running craft brewery experience. NEWBrew debuted in 2018 at the Singapore International Water Week, a global platform for the water industry to share and co-create innovative water solutions.  
  
NEWBrew was created as part of PUB’s efforts to educate Singaporeans on the importance of water recycling and reuse as a strategy to achieve water sustainability. Beer brewing requires high quality water and NEWBrew is testament that NEWater is perfectly clean and safe for drinking, and can be used to make a great tasting beer!  
  
The latest version of NEWBrew is a Tropical Blonde Ale, a highly quaffable beer suitable for Singapore’s tropical climate, with a smooth, toasted honey-like aftertaste.  
  
NEWBrew’s packaging features three different can designs, with vibrant artwork showcasing the Marine Barrage, MacRitchie Reservoir Park and the Singapore River – iconic water landmarks that contribute to Singapore’s water sustainability efforts and are also well-loved spots for leisure and to enjoy nature.
