Electro Mobility Solutions  
  
From Kilowatts to Kilometres  
  
Durapower offers high-performance lithium-ion battery solutions with perfect safety track records over a number of electro-mobility (e-mobility) applications from last mile two and three wheelers up to commercial vehicles such buses and trucks.  
  
Electric Buses  
  
As an integral part of public transportation systems, a bus system’s regularity and reliability are essential to its success. As the source powering these movements, Durapower’s high-capacity battery packs are built to take every advantage of fast-charging technologies, recharging within break periods to ensure a surplus of power throughout extensive operation hours.  
  
Servicing the Population of Eindhoven    
  
As an example of our dedication to crafting custom renewable energy solutions for electric automotives, Durapower was selected by VDL Groep to power their fleet of buses to service the 240,000-strong population of Eindhoven, Netherlands. To power the emission-free fleet, Durapower developed a ground-up proof of concept covering aspects such as custom-fitting battery modules and automatic battery charging. This adaptation of Durapower’s battery technologies was made possible through the combined versatility of Durapower’s battery systems and the dedication of the Durapower team to meet our clients’ specific needs.
