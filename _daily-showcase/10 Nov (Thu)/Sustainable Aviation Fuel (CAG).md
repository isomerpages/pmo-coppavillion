Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an important pillar for decarbonising aviation, with a potential of reducing carbon emissions by around 80% as compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel. As part of the SAF pilot, CAG collaborated closely with our airport partners to ensure that Changi Airport’s fuel hydrant system is suitable for the use of SAF. In this pilot, 1,000 tonnes of neat SAF were supplied by Neste and blended at ExxonMobil’s facilities in Singapore. The blended SAF was then supplied through Changi Airport’s fuel hydrant system to the departing aircraft. The green attributes were then accounted to the Singapore Airlines Group via the Book & Claim framework.  
  
Unlike ad-hoc SAF trials conducted via bowser refuelling, this concept of operations and distribution via the airport fuel hydrant system is an important step towards our long-term aspiration of achieving larger-scale uplift of SAF at Changi Airport on a regular, scheduled basis.
