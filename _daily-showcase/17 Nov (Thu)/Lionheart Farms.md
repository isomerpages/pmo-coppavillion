Connecting the Rich and the Poor  
  
Lionheart Farms is an enterprise that plants dwarf coconut palms within an agroforestry system spanning 3,500 hectares. Lionheart harvests coconut sap which it turns into products like coconut syrup, aminos and vinegar for export to developed nations. It has created over 1,000 jobs and will sequester 150,000 tons of CO2 in 2022, growing to 250,000 tons per year before 2027.  
  
Beneficial Returns made a loan to Lionheart in 2022, 80% of it funded by investors from Singapore. After Lionheart obtains the Verified Carbon Standard and the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard, its carbon credits from nature-based solutions will be available for offset against net carbon emitters in their journey towards carbon neutrality.
