ACX is designed to be efficient and transparent and a total game-changer for the end-to-end lifecycle of carbon credit ownership. Up until now, there have been multiple friction points in the credit cycle, from finding to buying to holding to retiring credits. There have also been considerable inconsistencies when it comes to the paper trail and reporting of credits.  
  
At ACX, we take a completely different approach by building an integrated system that uses advanced technology like blockchain to automate the process, resulting in secure, standardised digital contracts and consistent, visible documentation. The ACX approach streamlines the process and sets standards to simplify auditing requirements. We also keep transaction fees down to enable exchange participants to get more value and encourage reinvestment into sustainability projects. Our commitment is the establishment of benchmark pricing for the voluntary carbon market with ACX being seen as the preferred platform for a market-based price.
