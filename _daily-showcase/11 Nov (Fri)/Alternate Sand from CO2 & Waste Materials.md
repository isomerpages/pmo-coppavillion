To reduce our carbon footprint, Singapore has been investing in Carbon Capture and Utilisation technologies that would help to address both domestic needs and international challenges.  
  
A team from A\*STAR is developing?efficient and low-cost mineralisation technology using CO<sub>2</sub> from flue gas and waste materials to produce alternative sand.  
  
This project supports Singapore's?transition to a sustainable and low carbon future, and contributes to extending the lifespan of Singaporeâ€™s only landfill. It also increases alternative sources of sand for the local construction sector while?abatinge CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  
  
Preliminary outcomes include:  
\- Developing a CO<sub>2</sub> capture technology suited for dilute CO2 flue gas (~3-5%) specific to Singapore's context.  
  
\- Building a demonstration mineralisation unit producing up to 100 kg/month of alternative sand for evaluation of applications by industry collaborators.  
  
\- Reaching market parity with imported aggregates using the developed CO<sub>2</sub> capture and mineralisation process.
