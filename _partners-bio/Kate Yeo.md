#### KATE YEO

Kate's environmental journey began in 2018 as the founder of Bring Your Own Bottle SG, a campaign aiming to transform the culture of disposables in Singapore. She currently also serves as a core team member of Singapore Youth for Climate Action and a member of the UN Environment Programme's Major Group for Children and Youth. Through these different platforms, Kate enjoys organising events centred on climate justice and community building. She hopes to make the environmental movement more accessible and inclusive to all.
