## What isÂ COP?

**It is the defining moment in the fight against climate change.**

Recent IPCC reports have highlighted the gravity of the climate crisis and the need for immediate and sustained political will, impactful action and effective cooperation.

**It is the United Nations Climate Change Conference.**

Building on previous successes, the 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP27) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, seeks to further enhance the scope of deliverables across the climate action agenda and pave the way for future ambition.

COP27 is a golden opportunity to rise to the occasion and tackle effectively the global challenge of climate change.
